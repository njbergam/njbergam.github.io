<<<<<<< HEAD
I am a Computer Science PhD student at Columbia University, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~djhsu/">Daniel Hsu</a> and <a href = "https://ajblumberg.github.io">Andrew Blumberg</a>. Here is my <a href="https://njbergam.github.io/publications/CV.pdf">CV</a>. 

Research
======
I'm interested in the foundations of machine learning. I am drawn to problems where algorithmic, 
statistical, and geometric perspectives overlap, e.g. subjects like geometric data analysis and low-dimensional metric embeddings. I am also quite excited by the interdisciplinary possibilities of mathematical modelling, having done projects in natural language processing and geostatistical modeling.

Research
======
I'm interested in theoretical computer science, including foundations of machine learning, geometric data analysis, and (approximation) algorithms (for massive data). I am also quite excited by the interdisciplinary possibilities of mathematical modelling, having done projects in natural language processing and geostatistical modeling.

Teaching
======
There is so much knowledge out there. I think it's cool that people who put in the work of learning can help refine the knowledge base. I try to contribute where I can. <a href="https://njbergam.github.io/teaching/">This page</a> houses various presentations, expository writeups, and thoughts about life. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/njbergam">This YouTube channel</a> houses some videos and lectures.
