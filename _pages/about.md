I am a PhD student in the Columbia University Computer Science Department, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~djhsu/">Daniel Hsu</a> and <a href = "https://ajblumberg.github.io">Andrew Blumberg</a>. Here is my <a href="https://njbergam.github.io/publications/CV.pdf">CV</a>. 

Research
======
I'm interested in the foundations of machine learning and data science, particularly 
I like to bring together algorithmic, statistical, and geometric perspectives.

Teaching
======
eople who put in the work of learning can help refine the knowledge base. 
I try to contribute where I can. <a href="https://njbergam.github.io/teaching/">This page</a> houses various presentations, expository writeups, and thoughts about life. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/njbergam">This YouTube channel</a> houses some videos and lectures.
